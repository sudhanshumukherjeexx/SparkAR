# Getting Started with AR/VR

## Augmented Reality(AR)
Augmented Reality is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information.

# Step by Step Process to Buld 3 Instagram Filters

### 1. 3D Object Interaction in Augmented Reality 
We will explore 3D object interaction with the real world by creating a 3D animated object and placing it in the real-world environment.

### 2. Interaction with the Real-World Environment through our Camera Lenses 
In this filter, we will craft a SNOW effect and equip it with the ability to be controlled by tapping on the screen.

### 3. Modifying the Background
Utilizing 5 distinct UI pickers, we will alter the background to create 5 unique variations and include a button for easy access by clicking.
